# 🛍 Simple Python Store Project

This is a sample project of a *basic internal store system* developed in Python.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a simple store backend works, including product management, cart operations, and a symbolic online payment flow.

## 📦 Features

- Predefined list of products  
- Adding and removing items from the shopping cart  
- Cart summary with total price  
- A mock (symbolic) online payment process  
- Simple and clean console-based interaction
